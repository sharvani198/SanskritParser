There are many files in this folder which represent the dictionary for the parser.
Each file has a word which is encoded according to our own format.
In unicode, Sanskrit characterset begins at codepoint 2304.
The encoding we use converts each letter in the word to its unicode value and subtracts 2304. Also the format forces each letter to be represented in 3 digit code.
After encoded word is attribute set.
